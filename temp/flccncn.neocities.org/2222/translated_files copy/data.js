				<b>This CYOA is a deck-building card game.</b><br>
				You will build a deck with limited points and use this deck to engage in <b>Sex Duels</b> with champions.

				<br><br><br>

				<b>What is a Sex Duel?</b><br>  
				As the name suggests, it's a contest where you use your body and techniques to dominate your opponent and drive them to climax.<br>  
				<b>The first to reach their climax limit and break down loses, while the one left standing claims victory.</b>

				<br><br><br>

				However, there's an additional penalty for you.<br>  
				For a female challenger, defeat is not just a simple humiliation.<br>  
				<b>The defeated woman becomes the winner's 'property' and is reduced to an asset of the arena.</b><br>  
				<small><i>This rule is common sense, of course.</i></small>

				<br><br><br>

				You were likely a person of great talent, vast experience, high status, and renown.<br>  
				However, <b>none of that matters here.</b><br>  
				Now, you are nothing more than a spectacle to be mocked and consumed for the audience's pleasure.

				<br><br>

				<b>Will you graduate from life, or will you cast aside your dignity and seize victory?</b><br>  
				Everything will be decided on this stage.

				<b>Managing your points is the most important first step in deck building.</b><br>  
				You are initially given <b>100 points</b>, which you will use to build your deck.

				<br><br><br>

				Points are spent differently depending on the card's grade, and you <b>must fill the base deck size of 10 cards.</b><br>  
				Generally, you can only include one copy of each card in your deck.<br>  
				You cannot complete your deck if you exceed your points or have too few cards.<br>  
				<small><i>(The deck size can be changed by certain traits.)</i></small>

				<br><br><br>

				<b>The cards you can include in your deck are generally as follows:</b>

				<br><br>

				<b>Neutral Card (5pt):</b> The most basic card, usable regardless of class.<br>  
				Its individual performance as a card is low, but it can fill a deck slot at a cheap cost.

				<br><br><br>

				<b>Class Card:</b> Unique cards that can be used by specific classes.<br>  
				By grade, there are <b>Common Cards (10pt)</b>, <b>Adept Cards (15pt)</b>, and <b>Ultimate Cards (20pt)</b>.<br>  
				The higher the grade, the stronger and more special the effect, and the more points it costs.<br>  
				Therefore, including many high-grade cards will inevitably lead to a point shortage.

				<br><br><br>

				<b>Penalty Card:</b> A card that has a negative effect on you when included in your deck.<br>  
				In return, you gain points for adding this card.<br>  
				<small><i>(For details, check <b>[Deck Building (2/6): Penalty Cards]</b> ➡️)</i></small>

				<b>Race Bonus Card:</b> Depending on your race, you can add special cards to your deck.<br>

		        <b>Penalty Cards</b> represent flaws you possess.<br>

				In return, you gain points to supplement your limited resources.  

				<br><br><br>

				There are <b>10 types of Penalty Cards</b> you can choose during deck building.<br>  
				The more devastating the Penalty Card, the more points it provides.  

				<br><br>  

				If you are short on points and deck slots after including many high-grade cards,<br>  
				you can resolve the situation with Penalty Cards.  

				<br><br><br>

				The effects of a Penalty Card can be removed by playing it directly,<br>  
				discarding it via another card's effect, transforming it, combining it, etc.<br>  
				<b>By removing it from the deck through various means, its effect can be nullified.</b>  

				<br><br><br>

				<b>[Penalty: Declare Defeat]</b> is an exceptional Penalty Card that only has a negative effect when played.<br>  
				In other words, it's a safe card with no effect as long as you don't play it.<br>  
				It doesn't provide points, but it can be used as a stable option to fill a deck slot for free.

				<b>Arousal Limit</b> is the threshold you can endure from stimulation.<br>  
				If your Arousal reaches this value, you will <b>climax</b>, and your Arousal will reset to 0.

				<b>Climax Limit</b> is your physical limit for enduring orgasms.<br>

				They represent the various sexual positions you assume during a Sex Duel.<br>  
				<b>When you play a Position Card, you acquire that position and gain its effect permanently.</b>  

				<br><br>  

				However, you can only have one position at a time.<br>  
				When you acquire a new position, the effect of the previous one disappears.  

				<br><br><br>  

				Position Cards have powerful effects or effects that can be the core of your deck compared to other cards.<br>  
				<b>Their effects greatly influence the direction of your deck.</b>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Effects that occur during a duel are broadly divided into <b>Persistent Effects</b> and <b>Permanent Effects</b>.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Persistent Effects</b><br>
                A Persistent Effect is temporarily applied under certain conditions and disappears depending on whether a status or card is maintained.<br>
                This effect is indicated by keywords such as <b>'Persistent'</b>, <b>'Held'</b>, 'for this round', or 'until next round' on cards or statuses.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Characteristics of Persistent Effects:</b><br>
                <br>
                Disappears immediately if the card or status providing the effect is removed.<br>
                Does not change the <b>base value</b> of stats like <b>Lust, Heat, Arousal Limit, and Climax Limit</b>.<br>
                <br>
                The current value modified by a Persistent Effect is displayed in a different color.<br>
                The base value is shown in parentheses, allowing you to compare the current and original states.<br>
                e.g., <b>Heat</b> 2(1) → The current value of <b>Heat</b> is 2, but its base value is 1.<br>
                Persistent Effects are distinguished from Permanent Effects in that their stat changes are temporary.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Permanent Effects</b><br>
                A Permanent Effect is an effect that applies permanently from the moment a card's effect is activated.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Permanent Effects cannot nullify Persistent Effects.<br>
                e.g., If you have a "<b>Persistent: Heat +1</b>" effect and a Permanent Effect reduces your <b>Heat</b> to its minimum value of 1, your current <b>Heat</b> value will still be 2 due to the Persistent Effect.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                During a duel, it is crucial to check which Persistent Effects are currently active.<br>
                <br>
                By hovering your mouse over a stat, you can see a list of Persistent Effects currently affecting that stat.<br>
                This allows you to quickly grasp the current situation and prepare an appropriate response.<br>

			"title": "Effects & Rules (2/4): Extra Cards",
			"desc": `
		        Normally, the basic rule in a duel is to play one card per round.<br>
                However, by using the <b>Extra Card</b> effect, you can increase the number of cards you can play in a round.<br>
                Used properly, this effect can be a powerful tool to instantly turn the tables or pressure your opponent.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The Extra Card effect increases the number of cards you can play in the current round.<br>
                <br>
                Usually, the effect on a single card is commonly up to <b>'Extra Card +1'</b>; cards with a higher value are very rare.<br>
                If you choose to play a card with this effect, you can then continue to select additional cards.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Repeatedly using the Extra Card effect doesn't mean you can play an infinite number of cards.<br>
                <br>
                The maximum number of cards you can play in one round is <b>5</b>.<br>
                <small>This limit can be changed by certain traits or effects.</small><br>
                You can play cards with the Extra Card effect consecutively, but be careful not to exceed the limit.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Extra Card effects do not stack.<br>
                <br>
                Applying another <b>'Extra Card +1'</b> effect to a card that already has one<br>
                does not increase it to <b>'Extra Card +2'</b>.<br>

		{
			"title": "Effects & Rules (3/4): Arousal Value and Repetition Count",
			"desc": `
		        Card effects have two important properties: <b>Value</b> and <b>Repetition Count</b>.<br>
                While there is often little difference between these two, they create a subtle distinction specifically for effects that increase <b>Arousal</b>.<br>
                Understanding this difference can help you pressure your opponent more effectively or strengthen your defense.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are examples of the two types of effects:<br>
                <br>
                1. 'Increase the opponent's <b>Arousal</b> by your <b>Lust</b>.'<br>
                2. 'Give the opponent <b>+1 Arousal</b>, <b>Lust</b> times.'<br>
                <br>
                The first effect has a Value equal to your <b>Lust</b>.<br>
                This effect applies an amount of <b>Arousal</b> equal to your <b>Lust</b> in a single instance.<br>
                <br>
                The second effect has a Value of 1 and a Repetition Count equal to your <b>Lust</b>.<br>
                This effect applies a <b>+1 Arousal</b> effect, repeated for a number of times equal to your <b>Lust</b>.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The way these two effects work shows a clear difference when the opponent <b>climaxes</b>.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Effect with a Value of <b>Lust</b> (the first example):<br>
                <br>
                Applies an amount of <b>Arousal</b> equal to <b>Lust</b> all at once.<br>
                If the opponent <b>climaxes</b> once, the effect ends completely at that moment.<br>
                e.g., <b>Lust</b> 5, opponent's Arousal until climax is 3 → The opponent <b>climaxes</b> once, and the effect ends with no further increase in <b>Arousal</b>.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Effect with a Repetition Count of <b>Lust</b> (the second example):<br>
                <br>
                Applies the <b>+1 Arousal</b> effect a number of times equal to <b>Lust</b>.<br>
                Even if the opponent <b>climaxes</b> midway, the effect continues to apply for the remaining number of repetitions.<br>
                e.g., <b>Lust</b> 5, opponent's Arousal until climax is 3 → The opponent climaxes once, and then gains an additional <b>+2 Arousal</b>.<br>
                If the Repetition Count is high enough, it's possible to make them <b>climax</b> multiple times in a single round.<br>

			"title": "Effects & Rules (4/4): Random Penalty Cards",
			"desc": `
		        Effects that grant a random <b>Penalty Card</b> during a duel are dangerous effects that can suddenly change the situation.<br>
                This effect grants one of the 10 Penalty Cards that can be included in a deck, at random.<br>
                However, since the effect of a Penalty Card applies immediately upon obtaining it, it can lead to unexpected dangers.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Some cards have a <b>safeguard</b>, preventing them from appearing under certain conditions.<br>
                The following are Penalty Cards that will not appear under specific conditions:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>[Penalty: Erogenous Zone Development]</b><br>
                <small><i>(<b>Held: Arousal Limit -1</b>)</i></small><br>
                This card will not appear if your remaining <b>Arousal</b> until climax is 1.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>[Penalty: Masochism]</b><br>
                <small><i>(<b>Held: Climax Limit -1</b>)</i></small><br>
                This card will not appear if your remaining <b>climaxes</b> until defeat are 1.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>[Penalty: Frustration]</b><br>
                <small><i>(<b>Held:</b> [End of Round] If 6 or more rounds have passed, you lose the duel.)</i></small><br>
                This card will not appear from round 6 onwards.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This safeguard prevents immediate defeat situations and gives the player a chance to continue the duel.<br>
                However, there are no separate safeguards for the other Penalty Cards, so you must be careful.<br>
